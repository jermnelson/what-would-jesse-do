 <h3>Childhood</h3>
 <p>
  Jesse was the first sibling whom I regularly changed his diapers.  His adventures as a toddler caused 
  my mother and father no end of anxiety and anger, particularly when it came to Jesseâ€™s fascination with 
  our fireplace at our first home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade,_Colorado">Palisade, 
  Colorado</a>.

  Once as a toddler, Jesse was sick and so severely dehydrated, it required his hospitalization. 
  I remember for the first time being very scared we might lose him and how incomprehensible that loss would 
  be to me and our family.

  Later when we moved to the house on Smith Avenue, Jesse was always busy, playing house with my sister 
  Jill, and challenging my parents rules with trademark smirk with a twinkle in his eyes as he was about 
  to do something ornery. A trait he carried throughout his life.
