### High School and After
When I graduated from college, married my college girlfriend, and moved to 
[Champaign Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign,_Illinois), 
I heard stories of Jesse's legendary time in high school, doing all of the things I 
never did, playing football, elected president of student government, and being the 
center of [Palisade High School](https://phs.d51schools.org)'s social life.

When I divorced in 1999 and Jesse graduated in 2000, he moved into my home joining 
my brother Jake and his wife Lisa who were also living with me. These are some of my most 
cherished memories with the four of us living together cumulating in the momentous arrival 
of my brother Jake’s daughter Aura.

This shouldn't be much of shock, but Jesse and I loved to smoke weed together. He would laugh 
and joke on my pontifications on art, life, politics, technologies, and whatever else that 
drew a chuckle and a twinkle or two from Jesse. We exemplified the "pipe dreams" cliché in our 
many conversations over the years. One very early morning, Jesse woke me up for a wake-and-bake 
at 4:20 am on [4/20](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=420) (April 20th) 
just one of the many times he upended expectations while introducing me to a delightful new experience.

For my final story from this time, I had started practicing the martial art of Aikido a couple of years
when Jesse moved in, I "made" him take an Aikido beginner course. Back home, he was asking about a 
technique he had learned called [shihonage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vWR7EdQdM) which 
when done correctly requires the person being thrown to be able to take ukemi, or a controlled fall. As 
Jesse was always a good athlete, he executed the technique perfectly which totally surprised me and I had 
to take a high break-fall on the kitchen’s hard wooden floor. There have been a few times in my 28 years of 
Aikido practice that I have experienced pure aiki, or harmony, and that technique of Jesse’s is one of the 
first and one of the most memorable ones.
