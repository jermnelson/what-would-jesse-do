    <h1>What Would Jesse Do?</h1>
    <h2>An Oldest Brother Eulogy for Jesse Robert Nelson (1981-2025)</h2>
    <div class="row">
     <div class="col">
      <p>
       I am honored and blessed to have known and loved 
       <a href="https://www.minotdailynews.com/obituaries/2025/04/jesse-nelson/">Jesse Robert Nelson</a> for all of 
       his much too brief 43 years. Jesse represented the best of all of us brothers; his height, his charisma, 
       his love, his lust for life, and particularly relevant for me, his long luxurious hair!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever any of us family were together with Jesse, he always made us laugh with his caring and his love apparent 
       as he teased us with his humor and grace. As my father recently commented, the ancronym WWJD should now be changed to 
       <i>What Would Jesse Do?</i> for those of us in this room, for those friends and family who loved him, and for the 
       whole world.

      An important disclosure - there are times when you certainly should <strong>NOT</strong> do 
      what Jesse would do! Like smoking cigarettes.
    </div>
    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>
      Jesse was the first sibling where I regularly changed his diapers.  His adventures as a toddler caused 
      my mother and father no end of anxiety and anger, particularly when it came to Jesse’s fascination with 
      our fireplace at our first home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade,_Colorado">Palisade, 
      Colorado</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once as a toddler, Jesse was sick and so severely dehydrated, it required his hospitalization. 
      I remember for the first time being very scared we might lose him and how incomprehensible that loss would 
      be to me and our family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later when we moved to the house on Smith Avenue, Jesse was always busy, playing house with my sister 
      Jill, and challenging my parents rules with trademark smirk with a twinkle in his eyes as he was about 
      to do something ornery. A trait he carried throughout his life.
    </p>
    <h3>Pre-teens</h3>
    <p>
      While I was in high school, my Mom wanted me to do something with Jesse. I suggested we go camping (I 
      think it was earlier Summer) on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mesa">Grand Mesa</a>. 
      We were woefully unprepared. Our plan was to sleep in the bed of my Dad's blue truck but after night came 
      we were freezing so we ended up in the cab huddled together for warmth until sunrise and we then drove back 
      home forgoing our fishing plans. He never complained and I think partly because he was excited about 
      having an adventure with his oldest brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was working as lifeguard at Lincoln Park pool in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction,_Colorado">Grand Junction</a>, Jesse was there 
      swimming with some of his friends. He was always observant and he when saw my new ankle tattoo, he 
      asked me with all seriousness if it was the initials of my girlfriend. I laughed and said no, the tattoo 
      was of my <a href="https://www.knox.edu/">Knox College</a> fraternity, Sigma Nu in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galesburg,_Illinois">Galesburg, Illinois</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>High School and After</h3>
    <p>
      When I graduated from college, married my college girlfriend, and moved to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign,_Illinois">Champaign Illinois</a>, 
      I heard stories of Jesse's legendary time in high school, doing all of the things I 
      never did, playing football, elected president of student government, and being the 
      center of <a href="https://phs.d51schools.org">Palisade High School</a>'s social life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I divorced in 1999 and Jesse graduated in 2000, he moved into my home joining 
      my brother Jake and his wife Lisa who were also living with me. These are some of my most 
      cherished memories with the four of us living together cumulating in the momentous arrival 
      of my brother Jake’s daughter Aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shouldn’t be much of shock, but Jesse and I loved to smoke weed together. He would laugh 
      and joke while my pontifications on art, life, politics, technologies, and whatever else that 
      drew a chuckle and a twinkle or two from Jesse. We exemplified the "pipe dreams" cliche in our 
      many conversations over the years. One very early morning, Jesse woke me up so we could smoke a 
      bowl at 4:20 am on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=420">4/20</a> (April 20th) 
      just one of the many times he upended expectations while introducing me to a delightful new experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my final story from this time, I had started practicing the martial art of Aikido a couple of years
      when Jesse moved in, I "made" him take an Aikido beginner course. Back home, he was asking about a 
      technique he had learned called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vWR7EdQdM">shihonage</a> which 
      when done correctly requires the person being thrown to be able to take ukemi, or a controlled fall. As 
      Jesse was always a good athlete, he executed the technique perfectly which totally surprised me and I had 
      to take a high break-fall on the kitchen’s hard wooden floor. There have been a few times in my 28 years of 
      Aikido practice that I have experienced pure aiki, or harmony, and that technique of Jesse’s is one of the 
      first and one of the most memorable ones.
    </p>
    <h3>The early 2000s and Teens</h3>
    <p>
       Jesse moved to Portland Oregon soon after and I visited him two or three times. On my first trip I remember 
      staying with him and his best friend Tyler, playing 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Racer">Star Wars Pod Racer</a> on the Nintendo 64. 
      On another trip, we drove to the ocean and went crabbing and then driving to meet our Aunt Evie and spending 
      time with our cousin Monty.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my own struggles when I lived in Utah, Jesse was always compassionate but firm and his love for me 
      provided a light and waypoint in my own darkness and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the decade closed, Jesse was working at Blackjack in Grand Junction and he had the opportunity to purchase 
      the franchise. We always shared a love of entrepreneurship and I was his silent partner, providing the initial 
      investment for purchasing Blackjack and helped cover expenses in that first year. He would work 100+ hours a 
      week, often forgoing his own pay to meet payroll. I won't go into the ugliness of the lawsuit brought on by a
      few of his employees but when he told me he would have to declare bankruptcy and close the restaurant, he was 
      so apologetic, crying and worried that he was disappointing me. I never thought that and I was so 
      proud (and still am) of his hard work and effort. I am convinced that without the lawsuit, he would have made a 
      great success of Blackjack. He was never bitter towards his employees and even in the worst moments, kept his 
      trademark optimism and belief that things would get better.
    </p>
    <h3>The 2010s and teens</h3>
    <p>
      Jesse next worked as a manager for a Palisade Peach orchard in our hometown. I remember visiting him during a 
      harvest with my girlfriend, now wife, Melissa and her wonderful daughters Carmen and Meagan. Even though he 
      was extremely busy, he took the time to show us around and as you all know, Jesse was always generous with 
      whatever he could provide and we left with a box of peaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of my visits to Grand Junction, I stayed overnight in his old camper on his Whitewater property. We got 
      drunk, and I remember stumbling in the dark to try find the outhouse on his compound that he was building. Jesse 
      was a collector on scale rarely seen. I would joke to my brother Jarrett, that with 40 acres, Jesse was able to 
      indulge this and his pack rat tendencies and collected anything and everything. Jesse's grand plans for the 
      property were always in flux. I loved touring the property seeing his chickens, goats and rabbits, playing with his 
      dog Gunner, shooting his modified .308 AK-47 and my Ruger 10/22, and seeing his many "in progress" projects he was 
      working on.
    </p>
    <h3>The Last Years</h3>
    <p>
      Following the peach orchards, he then worked as an electrician with my brother Jake. Jesse adventures in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>  
      ended with him moving up to North Dakota upon the suggestion of my brother Judd. This began the period of his 
      life that I know he was at his happiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting and then marrying Ellie and followed by the births of his sons Noah and then David, Jesse was the 
      most content I ever saw him on the two times I was fortunately to visit. Jesse on my phone conversations 
      after that visit and leading up to our last one two weeks before his death, always spoke with such high regard,
      respect, and humor about his employees when he was working as General Manager of 
      <a href="https://pizzaranch.com/locations/nd/minot/305-37th-avenue-sw">Pizza Ranch</a> here in Minot.
    </p>
    <p>
      His growing property empire also provided me many smiles as he described his again, always changing plans.
      The houses and property he owed in remote central North Dakota towns I had never heard of like 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamoose,_North_Dakota">Anamoose</a>, 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake,_North_Dakota">Drake</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kief,_North_Dakota">Kief</a>, and of course the old Catholic church
      and house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour,_North_Dakota">Balfour</a>.
      I would sometime shook my head hearing Jesse's wheeling and dealing attending property auctions but knew 
      that it was just "Jesse being Jesse".
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Our world and my life is a lot less interesting and dim with the great light that was lost with
      Jesse leaving us. He will never be forgotten in my lifetime and my heart is irreversibly broken. Jesse was 
      one of the noblest, kindest, and greatest human I have ever known. It is a great injustice and tragedy that 
      he will not be able to watch Noah and David grow to adulthood with his wife Ellie. May all of us live up to 
      Jesse’s example of being genuine good (but ornery) and face with the world with his compassion, his sensitivity 
      for all living things, his sense of justice, and his consistent optimism for the future. 
      I love Jesse Nelson so much and I, my family, and his friends will never be the same.
