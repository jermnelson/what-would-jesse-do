<h1 class="text-center">What Would Jesse Do?</h1>
<h2>An Oldest Brother Eulogy for Jesse Robert Nelson (1981-2025)</h2>
<h3>By Jeremy Nelson</h3>
<div class="row" id="intro">
 <div class="col">
  <p>I am honored and blessed to have known and loved 
<a href="https://www.minotdailynews.com/obituaries/2025/04/jesse-nelson/">Jesse Robert Nelson</a> for all of 
his much too brief 43 years. Jesse represented the best of all of us brothers; his height, his charisma, 
his love, his lust for life, and particularly relevant for me, his long luxurious hair! Most of all, Jesse's
singular intelligence and emotional brilliance was evidenced as he really listened and tried to help you 
think through whatever problems or concerns you may have had. </p>
<p>Jesse was thinking and problem-solving all of the time. We found out that with all of 
his blood rushing to feed this magnificent human, it burst through a blood vessel, flooding his 
brain, and killing him.</p>
<p>Whenever any of us family were together with Jesse, he always made us laugh with his caring and his love apparent 
as he teased us with his humor and grace. My youngest sister Angie classifies us siblings as<br />
uppers (myself, Jake, and Jill) and the downers (Judd, Jarrett, and Angie), Jesse was the true middle child 
combining both uppers and downers traits. As my father recently commented, the acronym WWJD should now be changed to 
<em>What Would Jesse Do?</em></p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Jesse was the first sibling whom I regularly changed his diapers.  His adventures as a toddler caused 
my mother and father no end of anxiety and anger, particularly when it came to Jesse’s fascination with 
our fireplace at our first home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade,_Colorado">Palisade,Colorado</a></p>
<p><img src="static/imgs/01982-jesse-jill-jimmy-inman.png" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Once as a toddler, Jesse was sick and so severely dehydrated, it required his hospitalization. 
I remember for the first time being very scared we might lose him and how incomprehensible that loss would 
be to me and our family.</p>
<p>Later when we moved to the house on Smith Avenue, Jesse was always busy, playing house with my sister 
Jill, and challenging my parents rules with trademark smirk with a twinkle in his eyes as he was about 
to do something ornery. A trait he carried throughout his life.</p>

  <article class="col" id="pre-teen-and-teen">
<h3>Pre-teen &amp; Teen</h3>
<p>While I was in high school, my Mom wanted me to do something with Jesse. I suggested we go camping (I 
think it was earlier Summer) on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mesa">Grand Mesa</a>. 
We were woefully unprepared. Our plan was to sleep in the bed of my Dad's blue truck but after night came 
we were freezing so we ended up in the cab huddled together for warmth until sunrise and we then drove back 
home forgoing our fishing plans. He never complained and I think partly because he was excited about 
having an adventure with his oldest brother.</p>
<p>When I was working as lifeguard at Lincoln Park pool in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction,_Colorado">Grand Junction</a>, Jesse was there 
swimming with some of his friends. He was always observant and he when saw my new ankle tattoo, he 
asked me with all seriousness if it was the initials of my girlfriend. I laughed and said no, the tattoo 
was of my <a href="https://www.knox.edu/">Knox College</a> fraternity, Sigma Nu in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galesburg,_Illinois">Galesburg, Illinois</a>.</p>

<h3>High School and After</h3>
<p>When I graduated from college, married my college girlfriend, and moved to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign,_Illinois">Champaign Illinois</a>, 
I heard stories of Jesse's legendary time in high school, doing all of the things I 
never did, playing football, elected president of student government, and being the 
center of <a href="https://phs.d51schools.org">Palisade High School</a>'s social life.</p>
<p>When I divorced in 1999 and Jesse graduated in 2000, he moved into my home joining 
my brother Jake and his wife Lisa who were also living with me. These are some of my most 
cherished memories with the four of us living together cumulating in the momentous arrival 
of my brother Jake’s daughter Aura.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be much of shock, but Jesse and I loved to smoke weed together. He would laugh 
and joke on my pontifications on art, life, politics, technologies, and whatever else that 
drew a chuckle and a twinkle or two from Jesse. We exemplified the "pipe dreams" cliché in our 
many conversations over the years. One very early morning, Jesse woke me up for a wake-and-bake 
at 4:20 am on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=420">4/20</a> (April 20th) 
just one of the many times he upended expectations while introducing me to a delightful new experience.</p>
<p>For my final story from this time, I had started practicing the martial art of Aikido a couple of years
when Jesse moved in, I "made" him take an Aikido beginner course. Back home, he was asking about a 
technique he had learned called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vWR7EdQdM">shihonage</a> which 
when done correctly requires the person being thrown to be able to take ukemi, or a controlled fall. As 
Jesse was always a good athlete, he executed the technique perfectly which totally surprised me and I had 
to take a high break-fall on the kitchen’s hard wooden floor. There have been a few times in my 28 years of 
Aikido practice that I have experienced pure aiki, or harmony, and that technique of Jesse’s is one of the 
first and one of the most memorable ones.</p>

  <article class="col" id="early-2000s">
<h3>The Early 2000s</h3>
<p>Jesse moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> soon after and 
I visited him two or three times. On my first trip I remember staying with him and his best friend Tyler, playing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Racer">Star Wars Pod Racer</a> on the Nintendo 64
on Tyler's projector. On another trip, we drove to the ocean, went crabbing, and then drove to meet our Aunt Evie and spending 
time with our cousin Monty.</p>
<p>During my own struggles when I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah">Utah</a>, Jesse was 
always compassionate but firm and his love for me provided a light and waypoint in my own darkness and despair.
I began my spiritual journey as an empirical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheist_Quakers">Non-Theist Quaker</a>
as a member of the <a href="https://www.saltlakequakers.org">Salt Lake City Friends Meeting</a> in 2004. 
I am currently a member of the <a href="https://coloradospringsquakers.org">Colorado Springs Monthly Meeting</a> and 
an attender at the <a href="https://sfquakers.org">San Francisco Friends Meeting</a>. Jesse, myself and the rest 
of my siblings where raised by our parents in the <a href="https://jw.org/">Jehovah Witnesses</a> faith. I was never 
baptised but Jesse was. His churches in North Dakota, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Baptist_Church_(Kief,_North_Dakota)">Kief Liberty Baptist Church</a>
in Kief and <a href="https://livingwordminotnd.org">Living Word Lutheran Church</a> and in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minot,_North_Dakota">Minot</a> grew Jesse's Christian Faith. I share the same 
conception of God as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. I respect Yahwah, Buddha, Earth Seed, 
 Odin, Jehovah, Allah, and all of other rich world religions as did Jesse.</p>
<p>As the decade closed, Jesse was working at <a href="https://blackjackpizza.com">Blackjack Pizza</a> in Grand Junction 
and he had the opportunity to purchase the franchise. We always shared a love of entrepreneurship and I was his 
silent partner, providing the initial loan for purchasing Blackjack and helped cover expenses in that first year. 
He would work 100+ hours a week, often forgoing his own pay to meet his employees' payroll. I won't go into the 
ugliness of the lawsuit brought on by a few of his employees but when he told me he would have to declare 
bankruptcy and close the restaurant, he was so apologetic, crying and worried that he was disappointing me. 
I never thought that and I was so proud (and still am) of his hard work and effort. I am convinced that absent 
the lawsuit, he would have made a great success of Blackjack. He was never bitter towards those employees and even 
in the worst moments, ept his trademark optimism and belief that things would get better.</p>

<h3>The 2010s and Teens</h3>
<p>Jesse next worked as a manager for a Palisade Peach orchard in our hometown. I remember visiting him during a 
harvest with my girlfriend, now wife, Melissa and her wonderful daughters Carmen and Meghan. Even though he 
was extremely busy, he took the time to show us around and as you all know, Jesse was always generous with 
whatever he could provide and we left with a freshly picked box of peaches.</p>
<p>On one of my visits to Grand Junction, I stayed overnight in his old camper on his Whitewater property. We got 
drunk, and I remember stumbling in the dark to try find the outhouse on his compound that he was building. Jesse 
was a collector on scale rarely seen. I would joke to my brother Jarrett, that with 40 acres, Jesse was able to 
indulge his inner pack rat; collecting anything and everything. Jesse's grand plans for the 
property were always in flux. I loved touring the property, seeing his chickens, goats and rabbits, playing with his 
dog Gunner, shooting his modified .308 AK-47 and my Ruger 10/22, and seeing his many "in progress" projects.</p>
</article>
  <article class="col" id="last-years">
<h3>The Last Years</h3>
<p>Following the peach orchards, he then worked as an electrician with my brother Jake. After his commercial
hemp growing adventures in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> ended in typical
Jesse fashion, he moved to North Dakota upon the suggestion of my brother Judd. This began the period of his 
life that I know he was at his happiest.</p>
<p>Meeting and then marrying Ellie and followed by the births of his sons Noah and then David, Jesse was the 
most content I ever saw him on the two times I was fortunately to visit. Jesse on my phone conversations 
after that visit and leading up to our last one two weeks before his death, always spoke with such high regard,
respect, and humor about his employees when he was working as General Manager of 
<a href="https://pizzaranch.com/locations/nd/minot/305-37th-avenue-sw">Pizza Ranch</a> in Minot.</p>
<p>His growing property empire also provided me many smiles as he described his again, always changing plans.
The houses and property he now owed attending by bidding in property auctions in remote central North Dakota 
towns I had never heard of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamoose,_North_Dakota">Anamoose</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake,_North_Dakota">Drake</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kief,_North_Dakota">Kief</a>, and of course the old Catholic church
and house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour,_North_Dakota">Balfour</a>. We would spin yarns,
Jesse tempering my initial enthusiasm for his ideas about turning the Belfour Church into a book and/or antiques 
store with a coffee shop. My contribution to this dream was first a name, <strong>The North Dakota Book Co-op</strong>. 
To heat the church/bookstore/cafe, we would incorporate various computer servers in the bookshelves for 
fine-tuning my [company's]https://knowledgelinks.io) LLMs while marketing hosted 
<a href="https://folio.org/">FOLIO Catalogs</a> to an underserved market of Church Libraries 
(and other libraries of course).</p>
<p>In our last phone conversation mentioned above, we discussed planting multiple apple 
orchards in some of the city lots that he now owned. Jesse knew that revitalizing and 
repopulating these rural North Dakota communities required new local businesses and new 
agriculture models.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Our world and my life is a lot less interesting and dark with the great light that was extinguished with
Jesse leaving us. He will never be forgotten in my lifetime and my heart is irreversibly broken. Jesse was 
one of the noblest, kindest, and greatest human I have ever known. It is a great injustice and tragedy that 
he will not be able to watch Noah and David grow to adulthood with his wife Ellie. May all of us live up to 
Jesse’s example of being genuine good (but ornery) and face with the world with his compassion, his sensitivity 
or all living things, his sense of justice, and his consistent optimism for the future. 
I love Jesse Nelson so much and I, my family, and his friends will never be the same. </p>
<p>Please remember Jesse and try to live up to his example as a creative, spiritual, and most of all
loving human being.</p>
